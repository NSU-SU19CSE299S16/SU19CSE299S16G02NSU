## **Project details:**
## **1) Project Idea in brief:**


## **a) What problem are we trying to solve:**
#### In this day and age, people often find themselves unable to find the time to look after themselves and their health. As a result, major health issues are more likely to occur. In Bangladesh, there are not many pharmacies which are open 24/7.  With growing population every year, people dying due to lack of medication are increasing. This emphasizes the need for developing smart solutions to provide better quality healthcare services to all masses. It is undoubtedly true that technology is an important part of our daily lives. Nowadays, most people have computers, laptops, tablets and even smartphones. These devices have made communication easier. Nowadays, you can browse the internet from anywhere, anytime. Also, the technology has increased immensely in the past few years. Through our project, we intend to help our users and take care of all their healthcare needs. For cases of emergency, even after midnight, our team will be working so that our users will always have someone by their side when they need it. 


## **b) How would our product solve the problem:**
#### The Healthcare and Medicine Delivery System (HAMDS) is a quick gateway for easier medical transport. It is a system that allows the users to be at ease regarding there medicines or other healthcare problem. It allows its users to order medicines by simply taking a picture of their medical prescription; where the medication will be delivered within the shortest time. In the “emergency” option, the site also allows to call an ambulance to the user’s location and take them to the nearest hospital in case of emergencies.  The app has a section where it can set up appointments with doctors. Overall, this app is a solution to all the medical needs for any patient; from ordering medication to emergency cases.
