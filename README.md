## **Project Report**
## Introduction:
The healthcare and Medicine Delivery System (HAMDS) is a quick gateway for easier medical transport. It is a system that allows the users to be at ease regarding their medicine transportation and apppointments of doctors. It allows the user to order medicine. The users are also allowed to give appointments of doctors using this website. 

## Features
In our homepage, we have options of login for **admin** and login and register both for the **users.**

## **USER:**
After the user logs in , the page includes **featured medicines** and a **search bar**. Along with these two, it also has the option to redirect to the **‘medicines’** and **‘make appointment’** page.

## ** MEDICINE:**
The featured medicine has an **‘add to card’** form below it , which redirects it to another page which asks if we want to **continue shopping** or **proceed to checkout.**

## PAYMENT METHODS:
If we press the button **‘Proceed to Checkout’**, it asks for **selecting a payment method(i.e. bKash or uCash)**. Upon selecting the method, it will ask for a **transaction ID**, which can be generated by using http://hamds.test/agentsimulator.  After placing the ID , the order is confirmed and a notification pops up ,which says **‘Payment received’.**
Medicines can also be order by going to the **medicine page** from the home page and selecting the desirable medicine.

## ORDER:
After placing the order,  if we want to view the **user’s past orders**, it will show that the order status is **‘PAID’** if the transaction ID is given correctly. If not, the order status shows **‘PENDING’.**

## Make Appointment:
This page stores the data of all the **doctors**. It also has a button for every doctor, which can generate the appointments.

  * orders.
  
## Conclusion
This is a gateway for solving the problems for everything related to one's health; from his medicines to his doctors aswell. We designed this app , so that it can be easy to use.
