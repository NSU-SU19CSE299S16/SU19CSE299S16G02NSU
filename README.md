## **Project details:**
## **1) Project Idea in brief:**


## **a) What problem are we trying to solve:**
In this day and age, people often find themselves unable to find the time to look after themselves and their health. As a result, major health issues are more likely to occur. In Bangladesh, there are not many pharmacies which are open 24/7.  With growing population every year, people dying due to lack of medication are increasing. This emphasizes the need for developing smart solutions to provide better quality healthcare services to all masses. It is undoubtedly true that technology is an important part of our daily lives. Nowadays, most people have computers, laptops, tablets and even smartphones. These devices have made communication easier. Nowadays, you can browse the internet from anywhere, anytime. Also, the technology has increased immensely in the past few years. Through our project, we intend to help our users and take care of all their healthcare needs. For cases of emergency, even after midnight, our team will be working so that our users will always have someone by their side when they need it. 


## **b) How would our product solve the problem:**
The Healthcare and Medicine Delivery System (HAMDS) is a quick gateway for easier medical transport. It is a system that allows the users to be at ease regarding there medicines or other healthcare problem. It allows its users to order medicines by simply taking a picture of their medical prescription; where the medication will be delivered within the shortest time. In the “emergency” option, the site also allows to call an ambulance to the user’s location and take them to the nearest hospital in case of emergencies.  The app has a section where it can set up appointments with doctors. Overall, this app is a solution to all the medical needs for any patient; from ordering medication to emergency cases.

## 2) Features:
 1.	They can order medicines by sending a picture of their prescription taken from their phones. 
 2.	They can cancel the order of their medicines within a certain period of time.
 3.	The user can get their preferred doctor appointments.
 4.	In cases of emergencies , they will be able to use the site in the following way:
        
        * If the medicine is needed at the fastest possible time, then it can be delivered by accessing this feature of the site.
        
        * Ambulance is one of the most crucial things in emergencies. The users can ambulance called using the site.
 5.	Users will have their securities intact, since there will be a login and logout section of the app; where every user will be password protected. There will also be user roles which will restrict certain types of users to access some parts of the applications and access others parts which other users cannot. 
 6.	New users can always create new accounts using sign up feature of the app.
 7.	The users can also edit their information.
 8.	The user can view their previous records, such as, the medicines they ordered or the doctor’s appointment they took previously.
 9.	The admin user can edit medicine and doctor information (add , delete , update). They can also track all the orders that were placed.
 10.	The application design will be responsive and mobile-friendly.

## 3) Technology: 
We will use **_Laravel_**, which is a free, open-source PHP web framework, to do all the back-end programming. For the front-end, we will use **_Bootstrap_** which is also a free and open source framework, to design a responsive system which can be viewed flawlessly on mobile screens. We will also use vanilla Javascript in the app. Laravel itself comes with a lot of tools for us to work it, and we will use a lot of them to build this application. 


## 4) Monetization/Business plan:
Monetizing an application is crucial in order to keep it up and running. We are also looking to make profits off this application. To do so, the users will be charged with a base fee of 60 taka every time they order plus the delivery fee which is 50 taka, anywhere inside of Dhaka city. Users will also be charged with a specific fee whenever they book an appointment through the application. This fee will be varied depending on how difficult it is to get the doctor's appointment. This will usually be around 50-200 taka. The fees may be a bit high during the stages of the app’s lifecycle, but it will be lowered as the number of user increases.
Payments can be made through a number of ways; **Cash On Delivery, bKash, Rocket, uCash and MasterCard/Visa Credit Cards.** The user will be given these choices when placing the order among which he can select the method which is suitable for him/her.
