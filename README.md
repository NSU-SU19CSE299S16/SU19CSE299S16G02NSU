## **Project Report**
In our homepage, we have options of login for **admin** and login and register both for the **users.**

## **USER:**
After the user logs in , the page includes **featured medicines** and a **search bar**. Along with these two, it also has the option to redirect to the **‘medicines’** and **‘make appointment’** page.

## ** MEDICINE:**
The featured medicine has an **‘add to card’** form below it , which redirects it to another page which asks if we want to **continue shopping** or **proceed to checkout.**

## PAYMENT METHODS:
If we press the button **‘Proceed to Checkout’**, it asks for **selecting a payment method(i.e. bKash or uCash)**. Upon selecting the method, it will ask for a **transaction ID**, which can be generated by using http://hamds.test/agentsimulator.  After placing the ID , the order is confirmed and a notification pops up ,which says **‘Payment received’.**
Medicines can also be order by going to the **medicine page** from the home page and selecting the desirable medicine.

## ORDER:
After placing the order,  if we want to view the **user’s past orders**, it will show that the order status is **‘Completed’** if the transaction ID is given correctly. If not, the order status shows **‘Pending’.**

This page stores the data of all the **doctors**. It also has a button for every doctor, which can generate the appointments.
